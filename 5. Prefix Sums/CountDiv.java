/*
Write a function:

class Solution { public int solution(int A, int B, int K); }

that, given three integers A, B and K, returns the number of integers within the range [A..B] that are divisible by K, i.e.:

{ i : A ≤ i ≤ B, i mod K = 0 }

For example, for A = 6, B = 11 and K = 2, your function should return 3, because there are three numbers divisible by 2 within the range [6..11], namely 6, 8 and 10.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

A and B are integers within the range [0..2,000,000,000];
K is an integer within the range [1..2,000,000,000];
A ≤ B.

    {
        int num_B = (int) Math.floor( B/K );
        // note: take "Math.floor" which is the basic number

        // number of divisible values smaller than A
        int num_A = (int) Math.floor( A/K );
        // note: take "Math.floor" which is the basic number

        // number of divisible numbers
        int num_div = num_B - num_A;

        // note: plus one (if A % K == 0)
        // because "A" is also divisble
        // without "plus", "A" will be deducted
        int plus = 0;
        if(A % K == 0)
            plus = 1;

        // num_div + plus
        num_div = num_div + plus;

        // return the number of K-divisible values between A and B
        return num_div;
